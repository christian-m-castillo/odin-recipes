<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This homemade Creamy Chicken Soup is rich, silky, and the ultimate comfort food. It's brimming with tender vegetables, fresh herbs, and deliciously seasoned, juicy chicken in a creamy, savory broth. This gluten-free and dairy-free chicken soup is also paleo and AIP-friendly.</p>

<p>This Creamy Chicken Soup is absolutely delicious, with each ingredient building the depth of flavor. It begins with a sautéed mirepoix. Carrots, celery, onions, and garlic are lightly caramelized in olive oil to create a slightly sweet, savory, and aromatic flavor base. Juicy chicken is seasoned with black pepper, sea salt, smoky paprika, and warm turmeric to produce a savory, meaty flavor with an earthy spiciness. Fresh bay leaves, parsley, thyme, and oregano add an herbaceous depth of flavor.</p>
