<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This easy casserole is inspired by bold Mexican flavors. It's all in the homemade taco seasoning. Warm, savory, slightly spicy and zesty, with hints of herbal notes. The spice mix perfectly seasons the ground beef and creates a rich flavor base for the entire dish.</p>

<p>Quinoa and black beans cook in the oven in the beef's juices and bone broth, so there's no need to use separate dishes. It's topped with a vegan and dairy-free cheese sauce that bubbles and browns in the oven, lending a creamy mouth-feel like real cheese! Altogether, this dish is the epitome of comfort food and is a delicious option for a gluten and dairy-free one pot dinner.</p>
